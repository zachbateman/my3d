# my3d

my3d is a Python library for 3D visualization.  In addition to visualizing objects, it aims to provide interactivity and updateable/interactive content.  The goal is
to create a library that enables relatively easy, powerful 3D visualization from a Python interface.  The tools used to do the visualization itself can be anything (thinking three.js).

# Goals

 - High-level Python interaction
 - Excellent 3D camera handling/movement
 - Enable user interactivity with 3D world
 - Enable visualization dynamic...ness and updateability.
 - Highly performant visuals.  If it doesn't look good, there's not much point in going to all the trouble to make it in 3D.
 - Expanding on above, simple but fast visuals are preferred to complex but heavy visuals
